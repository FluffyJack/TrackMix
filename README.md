# TrackMix

This is a RubyMotion conversion of the TrackMix application you develop during the ["Your First Mac App"](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapOSX/books/RM_YourFirstApp_Mac/Articles/Introduction.html) getting started guide.

It's done without Interface Builder and so uses Auto Layout instead, which is basically the only complicated part to it.
